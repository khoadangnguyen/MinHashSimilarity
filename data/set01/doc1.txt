Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems capable of learning from data.
Instead of being explicitly programmed, these systems use algorithms to identify patterns and make decisions.
This ability to learn and adapt makes machine learning highly effective in dynamic environments.

There are three major types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Supervised
learning relies on labeled datasets to teach models, while unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in data without
labels. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, trains models through a reward-based system to maximize desired
outcomes.

Machine learning is widely used in applications ranging from email spam detection to self-driving cars. In healthcare,
it helps predict disease risks, while in finance, it's used to detect fraud and automate trading. As data becomes more
abundant, the influence of machine learning continues to grow.
