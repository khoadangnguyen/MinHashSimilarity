At its core, machine learning enables computers to learn from past experiences using data. Rather than being hard-coded
for every task, these systems evolve by analyzing information and improving their performance over time. Itâ€™s a key
driver behind the automation of intelligent behavior in software.

The main categories of machine learning include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. In supervised
learning, the system is trained with input-output pairs. In contrast, unsupervised learning works without labeled
outcomes, and reinforcement learning optimizes actions by interacting with an environment and learning from feedback.

From personalized product recommendations to autonomous vehicles, machine learning is embedded in many aspects of modern
technology. Industries like medicine and banking use it to analyze massive datasets and make accurate predictions.
Its potential continues to expand as algorithms and hardware improve.
