Machine learning is an AI field that empowers computers to learn and act without being specifically told how to
perform every step. It processes large amounts of data, detects trends, and builds models that improve automatically.
This self-improvement capability makes it ideal for complex and evolving challenges.

There are different types of learning in machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement. Supervised
learning uses labeled examples to map inputs to outputs. Unsupervised learning searches for structure within unlabeled
data. Reinforcement learning learns from trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

The applications of machine learning are vast and constantly growing. It's used to power voice assistants, filter social
media content, and guide medical diagnostics. With better data and computational resources, machine learning will play
an even larger role in transforming industries.
